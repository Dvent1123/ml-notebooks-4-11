# Data Proccessing Practice Collection
This is a small collection of the the 4 projects I have worked on during during the week of 4/4/2021. Two of the projects are based on E-Commerce data, one is based on University data, and one is based on financial data all 4 data sets were found on Kaggle. The four projects go through the data processing steps of the Machine Learning Process but they vary in how in depth they go and vary in how the data is analyzed.


## data_processing.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook is using the application_train.csv and it is practice to using plots to try to find relationships between different features. The data is using application data for a credit loan and attempts to find a correlation between who would default on a loan and who is at high risk for a loan. 

## Initial Exploration for E-Commerce.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook is a full analysis and model training as well, done on E-Commerce data. The model tries to predict if a certain package will be delivered on time based on certain attributes such as mode of shipment, cost, prior purchases, etc. 

## EDA and Model for Placement.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook is another full analysis as well as model training and is done on University data. The model tries to predict whether a student will be placed into a campus job or not. The data is based on multiple attributes such as gender, degrees, work experience, etc.

## E-Commerce Business Analysis.ipynb
This is another Jupyter Notebook based on E-Commerce data but only goes through the feature generation. The data is real data from 2010 and has invoice number, stock codes, descriptions, quantities sold, etc. The analysis is a pure business analysis so I didn't do it since I am simply trying to practice.
