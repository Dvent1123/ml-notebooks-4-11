# Data Proccessing Practice Collection
This is a small collection of the the 4 projects I have worked on during during the week of 4/4/2021. Three of the projects are based on E-Commerce data and one is based on University data, all 4 data sets were found on Kaggle. The four projects go through the data processing steps of the Machine Learning Process but they vary in how in depth they go and vary in how the data is analyzed.
